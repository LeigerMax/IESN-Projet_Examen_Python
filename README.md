## About The Projet

It is a small board game (10 squares by default) on which a player moves and must collect candies that appear randomly. The player has one minute to collect as many as possible. When you pick up a candy, it may be that this candy is magic, the magic candies spawn between 1 and 5 candies. In the basic game we have two enemies that walk randomly on the map, once it touches a candy, the candy is eaten. If the enemy touches a player he loses 2 points. If the player touches more than 10 points, he loses all his points!
